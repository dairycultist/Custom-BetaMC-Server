# Custom-BetaMC-Server

A project for writing a vanilla client-compatible servercode for Minecraft beta 1.7.3 in C.

networking reference: https://pixelbrush.dev/beta-wiki/

slimefun plugin: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4

it basically added a bunch of items that you could unlock the crafting recipes of with xp, like u open a menu and there's a big skill tree with different categories, and you can unlock the ability to craft cool items like jetpacks and lucky blocks

NOT a faithful port of a vanilla server + plugins
